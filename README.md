# flatmark

A lightweight, super-simple, flatfile-based bookmark app

## Format specification

The core of **flatmark** is a plaintext file containing all bookmarks. The format
is inspired by successful and simple formats like todo.txt â€” there are only
three rules:

- a bookmark is one line in the file, beginning with the link itself
- after the link follows a whitespace and an optional description in brackets
- after the description there are tags indicated by the hash-sign

A simple example would look like this:

    https://www.github.com (Optional description) #some #optional #tags
