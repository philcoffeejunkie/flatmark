# flatmark

A lightweight, super-simple, flatfile-based bookmark app

## Format Specification

The core of **flatmark** is a plaintext file containing all bookmarks. The format
is inspired by successful and simple formats like todo.txt â€” a bookmark is one
line in the file consisting of three parts:

- the link itself, starting with the protocol string (mandatory)
- a description in parentheses (optional)
- tags for later filtering, indicated by the hash-sign (optional)

A simple example would look like this:

```
https://www.github.com (Optional description) #some #optional #tags
```

I want to encourage everybody to write your own app for whatever platform
to handle flatmark bookmarks!

## Planned Features (TODO)

- [x] Deleting bookmarks
- [x] Add some CSS to make the webapp look nice
- [ ] Export/Import functionality for the whole bookmark-file
- [ ] Edit bookmarks
- [ ] Provide authentication
